# Project Description/Outline
We will be analyzing the correlation between the job market for data scientists, average salaries for these jobs, and average cost of living in various cities in the U.S.

# Questions to answer
What are the top 5 best and top 5 worst states in the U.S. for a data scientist to live in terms of median annual salary?

What are the top 5 most expensive states to live in and the top 5 least expensive states to live in?

What recommendations can be made to individuals working in the data science field to navigate the balance between job opportunities and housing affordability in urban areas?

What is the best city to live in as a data scientist based on all this information?

How does the average data scientist salary after tax compare to that of other professions in each state? Which are the highest positive and negative state?

What have you been working on?
Finalizing data sets we will be using, downloading files to jupyter notebook, starting to code as a group

What do you plan to work on between now and in next class?
Continue coding, answer our individual questions

Any blockers, issues, question?
We were having trouble working with an API, but ultimately decided against it. 

Also, how do you feel about your progress so far?
We would like to be a little more ahead, but we were having trouble with our data sets. We are more on track now and have a solid foundation.
